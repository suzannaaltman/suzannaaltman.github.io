            <p>In FY15, Suzanna successfully launched the largest and most complex program ACF has produced in many years. It required exemplary skills in planning, communication, financial management, marketing, collaboration, relationship building, and "people management" of a wide array of personalities and egos. Suzanna exceeded expectations in every area and, as a result, the inaugural year of <em>NextNotes<sup><small>TM</sup></small></em> was a resounding success and its future looks very promising. A year ago we were treading on unchartered ground with many unanswered questions. As far as I'm concerned, the only thing that was certain was that we had the right person in charge of the program, and that was definitely the case.<br></p><p><em> - American Composers Forum Employee/Supervisor Review, August 2015</em></p>
